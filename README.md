# calculator_PROJ1
Simple calculator as a coding project to learn c++


# Quick Start:
  - clone the repository into a directory on your computer
  - change to that directory in the terminal
  - compile the calculator.cpp file with g++:<br>
            `g++ -std=c++11 -o calculator calculator.cpp`
    <br>(or if you already have a g++ version that supports c++11 or newer, use just: `g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp`)
  - run `./calculator`
